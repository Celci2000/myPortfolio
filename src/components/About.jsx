        "Hello! I'm a third-year Computer Science student at College of Engineering Trivandrum. My passion lies in the world of web development and product management. I enjoy crafting user-friendly and visually appealing websites that make a positive impact.One aspect of my journey that I truly cherish is the opportunity to meet new people. Collaboration and teamwork have played a vital role in my growth as a developer. I even did an internship at TinkerHub Foundation. There I got a chance to connect with like-minded individuals, exchange ideas, and work together to bring ideas to life.

        The thing that I love about being a web developer, and a developer in general, is and always has been the sole fact that it lets me create new things out of nothing.

You can come up with an idea and just bring it to life only using your fingers and a keyboard, and you donâ€™t need to be a genius, nor an artist, nor an artisan."
